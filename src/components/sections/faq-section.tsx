    answer:
      'We use enterprise-grade encryption (AES-256) for data at rest and in transit. All integrations use OAuth 2.0 authentication, and we never store your passwords. Your data is isolated and complies with GDPR and SOC 2 standards.'

  {
    question: 'Can I use this tool for my team?',

    question: 'Can I switch plans anytime?',

  },
  {
    question: 'Can multiple team members use one account?',
    answer:
      'Each team member needs their own user account, but these can be grouped under a single team workspace (available on Pro and Enterprise plans). This ensures proper activity tracking, permissions, and personalized agent experiences for each user.'
  },
  {
    question: 'How secure is my data?',
    answer:
      'Your data security is our top priority. We employ bank-level encryption, regular security audits, automated backups, and strict access controls. All our infrastructure is SOC 2 Type II certified and GDPR compliant.'
